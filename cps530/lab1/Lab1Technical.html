        My page is password protected using a script which prompts the user to enter a password. If the password entered is correct, the script then opens a new tab which links to my lab homepage.
        If the password entered is incorrect, the user is prompted again to enter thier password.The user has 3 attempts to enter a correct password after which the window becomes inactive.
        
        Since I am new to HTML, I decided to go with a tag I'd be able to implement without difficulty. Therefore I chose the pre tag. 
        The pre tag works by displaying all text within it the same way it is displayed in the HTML code. As well, I also used the textarea tag to display my HTML code for the Lab1 homepage.
        
        As for physical differences between browsers, they seem to be quite minimalistic. I have access to Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and the biggest difference that I can find is what seems
        to be a slight change in font type and size. Aside from that, all elements are laid out in the same locations and all function properly.
        
        I spent approximately 3 hours on this lab. Althogh, most of that was because I am new to HTML and needed to familiarize myself with the tags and elements
        that I would need to use to complete this lab.
