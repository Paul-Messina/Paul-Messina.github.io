        The element CSS class I used is called table1 and changes the font colour of the table I used into dark blue.
        
        I used two global CSS classes (.paragraph and .rounded).
        .paragraph changes the font family to sans serif and the colour to purple
        .rounded creates a rounded orange border around a div
        
        My HTML5-only tags are an iFrame tag containing a link to a youtube video. As well, I used the article tag.
        
        My CSS3-only features are text-shadow which I used in the page header and border-radius which creates a rounded border.
        
        Yes I used the same protection method with JavaScript. It is not really secure but when we learn about more secure methods I will implement them.
        
        This Lab took me approximately 2 hrs.
