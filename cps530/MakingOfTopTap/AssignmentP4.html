    <div class="textArea"><p>Before the group started working on the Assignment the planning phase occurred. The group discussed what they wanted to make and how they were going to divide the tasks. There was a discussion of what type of website the group wanted to make, overall the group agreed on a website that would represent a mobile game developer website. Furthermore, the group determined what type of front-end and back-end frameworks the group would use to develop their website. The group decided to use React as the front-end framework, Node.js as the back-end framework and use full stack javascript to accomplish this. The group also talked about the timeline that they would set in order to accomplish the task at hand. A decision of finishing the assignment one week before its due date was set. This would allow the group to use the extra time that they have, in order to test and make sure that their website is working as intended.</p>
