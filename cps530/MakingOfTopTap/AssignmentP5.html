    <div class="textArea">
        <p>To conclude our assignment, we would like to talk about our overall experience with using the frameworks that we choose. Using React and Node.js was a valuable experience as both are extremely popular in today's web development. They are highly efficient and powerful frameworks that give developers a lot of freedom when creating enterprise-grade websites. When creating our website using React and Node.js we were very happy with the performance of both frameworks. We initially did research on the frameworks and how they functioned so that we were able to choose the most fitting and appropriate frameworks for our assignments functionality. As a group we were very pleased with React as it did exactly what we hoped it would do, efficient and simple user interface. It was great working with React as a lot of components that we created were reusable meaning that a lot of time was saved, where we did not need to recode certain sections of the website. Working with Node.js was also a fantastic experience. When we researched Node.js we hoped to use the framework's component refresh functionality to allow us to only refresh certain parts of the website rather than refreshing the whole page every time. It is safe to say now, that we are pleased with the choice that we made by using Node.js for the functionality that we were looking for. The installations of the frameworks, were slightly confusing at first, however after finding out how to install them, they were not that difficult to configure. For the installation we used homebrew to install npm, and then ran the commands `npm install node` and `npm install react`. To start the node project we ran the simple command `npx create-react-app TopTapLandingPage` where npx is the package runner tool, `create-react-app` is the command and `TopTapLandingPage` is the name of our project. Creating pages with the frameworks that we used was fairly simple, especially with React. Making pages with React was easy as it uses javascript for most of the code that you must write in order to create a webpage. Which was not bad, as javascript tutorials are very popular online and that we went over javascript in our lectures. We used  Node.js for the form submission with the help of the `nodemailer` dependency this allowed us to have users submit real forms to a email that we  specified in our code.The learning curve from HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP is kind of steep. This is mostly due to the fact that React and Node.js are a combination of some of the web developing languages above. React and Node.js are difficult to learn not because they are totally new concepts, but mostly because you have to learn how to properly integrate some of the previously mentioned web development languages together in order to create functional web pages. Also the whole dynamic of the way the code is structured and how it connects to one another was different from the languages we had prior experience with. This again brought a slightly harder learning curve as you must get used to understanding how your code works in a completely foreign coding environment. In the end we were very satisfied with the choices that we made, and how the website turned out in the end. 
 
            If given more time, there are many more features we would have liked to add such as; 
            A page for ‘careers’,
            Videos of gameplay that displayed when hovering over the games (or a page that showcased the games in more detail), and
            a carousel or video of gameplay behind the company logo.

            In the future we are planning on working more on the website as there is still a lot more we can add, to make the website a fully functional top to bottom site that can be used by a real mobile app developer to showcase their games or apps on the internet.


            What we could do differently next time
            Build the node.js application and react application in separate projects so that the front end could be hosted on a CDN for faster initial load time, and greater scalability. 
            (The backend would be hosted on AWS elastic beanstalk and the front-end in an amazon S3 bucket)
