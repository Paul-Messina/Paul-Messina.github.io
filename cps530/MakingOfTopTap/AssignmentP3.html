    <div>Making a Good Looking Page Using React/Node.js</div>
    
    <div class="textArea"><p>Using React/Node.js it was really easy to make a great looking website. With React being responsive out of the box, all we had to worry about was creating and styling components with css. A great advantage of React is the component system, which allows us to style a component once, and then use it throughout the website passing proptypes that can be used as its attributes (think passing a parameter to a function). This was especially helpful for things like the game icon that hovers with a css animation, so that when more games are made new icons can be added quickly. This is done with the &lt;GameIcon&gt; component, passing the image and description as properties to the GameIcon tag. With this ability, React allows us to scale and grow the website fast, keeping the content consistent and responsive.</p></div>
