    <div>Frameworks</div>
    
    <div class="subHeader">React</div>
        
    <div class="textArea"><p>React is a javascript library used for building single page websites or mobile applications. It is a front-end framework used for building responsive web pages. React was built and is still maintained by Facebook a popular social network website. Some of the most popular websites that use react are ; Facebook , Instagram, Khan Academy, Yahoo Mail, and many more. React is a fairly popular library for creating great looking websites that are responsive to the user. Some strengths of React is its reusable, composable, and stateful components. Components in React are great as they can be reused in many parts of your code. This means that once you create a component you can then use it in any part of your program. React also ensures faster rendering. React has Virtual DOM which prevents bottlenecks from happening on the site as only certain components of the website are refreshed when need be, rather than the whole page refreshing every time. React also guarantees stable code as any changes that are done to the child structures do not affect their parents, as React uses downward data flow. Using this structure of data binding ensures code stability and continuous app performance. Lastly React is easy-to-learn and is fairly popular among start-ups and fortune 500 companies. As it is using javascript which is a popular web developing language, this allows many developers who know javascript to instantly utilize the benefits of React as javascript is a huge component of writing React. However, React also has some disadvantages that it brings with itself. One disadvantage is documentation, currently since React is such a new library compared to other libraries or frameworks, there is a lack of true documentation. As new features release for React, there are no good documentation that gets released with them, as they are fairly new and documentations usually take a long time to write up as people test and find the best ways to use the new features. This can be a problem if a developer wants to use a newer feature, and there is no good documentation available, preventing the developer to be able to efficiently use the new feature as they would have to test how it works and create their own documentation for the feature. Another disadvantage of React is that it uses JSX which is a syntax extension. JSX allows for a mixture of javascript and HTML code. This can be confusing for developers as they have to remember the syntax of both languages in order to code their web pages.  </p></div>

  <div class="subHeader">Node.js</div>
    
    <div class="textArea"><p>The benefits of using Node.Js is that it is lightweight for small websites that require low computation power, allowing for up to 4,000 concurrent visitors on 8GB of ram. Another great advantage of using Node is NPM or the “node package manager” this allows for quick installation of components that have already been made within the community so that development teams are not left re-inventing the wheel. We used npm to install a package called “express”, which manages the server processes, and a package called “react-responsive-modal” for the modal used to display the privacy policy. This, along with the ease of learning, allows small development teams to bootstrap scalable products in a relatively short amount of time. However, one disadvantage of Node.js is that since it is still a very new framework, the API changes often, sometimes making it difficult to keep up with the updates if the project is not being attended to full time. The reason we chose Node as our backend is because it is a new language that is gaining popularity among new companies, and we wanted to dive in and get our hands dirty with a new framework.</p></div>
